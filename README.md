# Azurepolicy

SQL auditing policy. Assign with deployifnotexists. Variable groups allow for deployment to different subscriptions with different Log Analytics workspaces and/or eventhubs. Update variables section where applicable. Did not use this policy on management group level yet, needs work for that.
